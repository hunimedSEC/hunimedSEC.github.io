# Meditation Club

A 13 minute meditation where we try to align your breath, thought and awareness. When these 3 things are aligned in one direction, it is said that you rise to the peak of your potential as human being.

You are increasing your knowledge and competence here in the university, but we think it is also important to enhance yourself as a life. So that you are functioning with less friction in your work, in your relationships. 
Becoming meditative is a quality of your presence that will influence all the people and situations around you.



18:30 Tuesdays and Thursdays - Room 19
